                        Update! In this month my exam has started so, i have to postpone my some goals. After exam completion, I will work on two part same as before Development and Preparation. This time i will be do my jobs with more discipline manner or consistency like I will download all lecture in my laptop so, i can't be distracted by internet and will give my phone to my Mom.
                        In Development part I will learn react js (in my opinion it will be completed in few days) and backend (node js, next js) also will do some DSA question if I have time left in between my preparation. BYe peacOut!
